#  ðŸ“Œ About Me


Hi! I'm **Jithendra Sri SivaKesava Siddartha Puppala**, a graduate student pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering** (Fall 2025â€“Spring 2027). I am deeply passionate about **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**, and I thrive at the intersection of research, real-world impact, and scalable systems.

Before NYU, I worked as a **Data Scientist at Jio Platforms Limited**, where I led the development and deployment of machine learning models for time-series cattle heat detection systems. My work directly contributed to a 4x increase in revenue through smarter agricultural technology.

My technical experience spans:
- Building and optimizing production ML models
- Designing and deploying REST APIs using Flask
- Working with time-series data, semi-supervised learning, and ARIMA models
- Collaborating with teams to ship analytics dashboards

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m passionate about **ethical AI**, **tech-enabled social change**, and **mentoring student developers**. Iâ€™ve served as a Campus Director for the Millennium Fellowship and led inter-NIT workshops focused on student leadership and innovation.

Currently, Iâ€™m looking for **Data Science Internship opportunities for Summer 2026** where I can apply my skills, curiosity, and values to make meaningful contributions.
